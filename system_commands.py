#Subprocess allow us to send command line commands to windows through python.
#(We do this so that we can piggyback multiple commands.  It allows us to save time typing.  
# We can also be clever and only output what we are interested in, 
# instead of sifting through unessential information.  Donâ€™t work harder, work smarter.)
